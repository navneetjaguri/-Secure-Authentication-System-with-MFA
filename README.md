# 🔐 Secure Authentication System with MFA

A robust and modern **authentication system** built with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to provide enhanced security for user accounts.  
This project demonstrates best practices in **user authentication**, **password hashing**, **session management**, and **MFA integration** (via email/OTP/Authenticator app).
